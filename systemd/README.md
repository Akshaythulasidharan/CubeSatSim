To make the CubeSat Simulator transmit automatically on boot, follow these steps, which were derived from https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/systemd.md


Log into the Pi and type:

sudo cp ~/CubeSatSim/cubesatsim.service /etc/systemd/system/cubesatsim.service

sudo systemctl enable cubesatsim

Reboot to start the autoboot service:

sudo reboot now

Now after the Pi starts up, the demo.sh script will run automatically, and the console will log to ~/CubeSatSim/log.txt  To see it:

tail ~/CubeSatSim/log.txt
